# Anti-Cheat and You

Cheating in Team Fortress 2 has been a continuous problem both inside and outside of the competitive scene. Due to a combination of cheats becoming more and more sophisticated over the past couple years, a lack of action from Valve in stopping said cheaters, and a lack of suitable server-side anti-cheat plugins, it is up to us, the Anti-Cheat team, to take preventative measures in stopping said cheaters.

For the safety of the other Anti-Cheat members outside of the Head Anti-Cheat admin, they shall remain anonymous as to not be harassed by members of the community if they come to a verdict that you don’t agree with. We hope you understand this decision.

## Transparency
Transparency amongst the Anti-Cheat team is something that is very important to us. It is also very important in how careful we are about it. When it comes to transparency, we don’t want to accidentally leak the tools and techniques we use to review evidence as this would make it easier for cheaters to hide their possible use of assistance and circumnavigate detection from our Anti-Cheat team.

## Usage of 3rd Party Software
Usage of 3rd party software is something we extend much further than just a cheat client hooked into your executable. We are, of course, talking about the usage of software that allows you to manipulate your audio to enhance your hearing capabilities and the usage of mouse software. Most software shall be dealt with on a case-by-case basis with the underlying question: does this software give an unfair advantage over the other players in the server? Using said question, we can come to a unanimous decision on whether or not we think a particular piece of software should be allowed in competitive play and which ones shall incur bans/penalties. If you are unsure of the legality of your case, please contact an administrator.

## Audio Equalizers:
Usage of audio equalizers have been heavily debated ever since the River case in Season 4 of Highlander NA RGL. Audio equalizers allow players to isolate specific sound ranges to enhance their hearing capabilities towards certain audio cues (for example, spy decloak sounds, footsteps, etc.). The Anti-Cheat team has come to a unanimous decision that usage of audio equalizers is a bannable offense and will incur a cheating ban if found using said software.

## Mouse Software:
Mouse software (such as the Logitech Gaming Software) can be used to customise your mouse and many of them can be used to create macros to achieve various different tasks. Macros made to bypass or exploit various different movement/engine restrictions will result in a cheating ban. However, usage of a macro to change your sensitivity (your mouse DPI) is allowed. If you are unsure of the legality of something, please contact an administrator.

## STV vs. POV
This is something that we want to make abundantly clear; and that is the distinction between STV demos and POV demos. To some, this may be a no-brainer, but to those that don’t quite know nor understand the difference between the two, let me break it down for you. The STV demo behaves and looks the same as when you are spectating another player. As you may know, when you spectate another player, it can look kind of “laggy” and things don’t quite line up with how they should. This is because STV demos aren’t lag compensated unlike POV demos. POV demos are exactly as the client sees their game. It will be almost 1:1 to everything that happens and is also lag compensated. So before you come rushing to us calling hacks on someone because something looked a little off in the STV demo you reviewed, please know it may not look the same in the POV the Anti-Cheat team requests and reviews.
Can the Anti-Cheat Team Provide POV’s Of Their Suspects?
The answer is simple: no we will not. You may not ask any member of the RSL staff team, both inside and outside of Anti-Cheat, for a POV demo of anyone we’re investigating. If someone we’re investigating chooses to make their POV’s available to the general public then that is up to them. The Anti-Cheat team, however, will not.

## Banned Scripts & Game Exploits
### Scripts:
Scripts that allow players to perform in-game actions they would not be able to perform without scripts, scripts that intentionally disrupt hitboxes, scripts that freeze player models to make it harder to hit and scripts or programs that enhance a players sense of hearing are banned.

The following is a list of examples of banned scripts:
- Bhop script.
- Panic script.
- Charge turn script.
- 180* turn script.

The following is a list of examples of allowed scripts:

- No dust from bullet holes script.

If you are unsure if a script is allowed/banned, please contact an administrator BEFORE playing in an official match otherwise penalties will incur.

### Exploits:
Abusing unintended game mechanics in order to gain an unfair advantage is considered exploitation.

The following is a list of examples of banned exploits:
- Entering the default playermodel pose (also known as “civilian pose”).
- Removing the Sniper scope UI.
- Box shadows.
- Spy cloak / footsteps / Ubercharge sound scripts and hearing aids (this includes 3rd party software that allows you to boost specific game sounds) or editing your surface properties. *
- Altering game files to make specific objects/textures transparent, or to cause lighting abnormalities. *

*Note: A cheating ban will be given for exploits marked with an asterisk.*

## Ban Lengths

### Cheating:
- Match Fixing - 1 year
- Valve Anti-Cheat Ban - 2 years (unless proved to be non-TF2 related)

### Failure To Submit Demos:
- 1st Offense - 3 match ban
- 2nd Offense - removal from the season
- 3rd Offense - removal from the league

## Anti-Cheat Reporting
If you have someone you wish to report, please follow the following steps carefully:
1. Download the STV of the suspect.
2. Review said STV demo.
3. If you find something you think is suspicious, write it down along with the tick it happened at and your best description of what you believe you saw.
4. Submit it to our Discord bot, Alfred. This process is simple: message the bot, wait for a staff member to tell you your newly created ticket has been moved to our internal Anti-Cheat category.
5. Submit new evidence if you happen to get any, but do not go antagonizing or otherwise contacting the suspect for ANY reason. All evidence on your part should be collected without interacting with the suspect.

That is the process. You’re done at step 5. The Anti-Cheat team will take the reins from here and begin an investigation. After that, you are not to interact with the suspect, or discuss your submission outside of the ticket, with anyone or for any reason. Failure to do so will incur infraction penalties. You are not entitled to progress updates or information, and do not expect to be updated as such.
