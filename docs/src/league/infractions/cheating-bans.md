# “Cheating” Bans

The use of third-party game altering software and hardware is considered cheating, but is not covered by the Infraction System. Instead, these offences will follow the punishments below:
- Match Fixing = 1 year Community Ban and Competitive Ban
- Valve Anti-Cheat Ban = 2 year Community Ban and Competitive Ban
- Evidence from Anti-Cheat = 2 year Community Ban and Competitive Ban

**A second offence for one of the above will result in a permanent ban from all league services. Take this as your one and only warning.**
