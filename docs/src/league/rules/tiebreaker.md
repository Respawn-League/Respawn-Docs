# Tie-Breaker
Teams with the same amount of Points will be separated based on 3 factors. The first will be Tied-Wins. A teamâ€™s Tied-Wins score is dependent on the number of maps they have won against teams with the same amount of Points.
The second factor is the Total Score. This value is based on the number of rounds scored in each match played by a team. For example, a game with the score 2-1 would give 2 Total Score to the winning team and 1 Total Score to the losing team.
The final factor is Total wins, which is the amount of map wins a team has. 
These Tie-Breakers will be prioritised in the order given when deciding a tied situation on the leaderboard. Forfeit wins do not count towards this.
