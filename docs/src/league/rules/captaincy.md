# Captaincy

## Responsibility
Captains shoulder the burden of most if not all team issues, and each incident is reviewed. It is not always the fault of the captains; however, but everything and anything your team does, falls under your banner.

## Disbanding/Removed
Disbanded, removed and disqualified teams all qualify under captaincy punishments.
Some punishments for captains will include captaincy ban for the following season, with further incidents incurring more severe penalties ranging from a permanent captaincy ban to league bans.
