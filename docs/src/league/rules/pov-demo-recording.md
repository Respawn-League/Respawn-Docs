# POV Demos / Point-of-View Demo Recording
**All players are expected to record POV demos of their official matches**. **Upon request by the staff team, the POV needs to be submitted within 48 hours**. Reports of a player cheating or other disputes may also get your POV requested. POV Demos must be kept for 6 months from their recorded date. We also expect that POV Demos are recorded for scrimmage matches and are kept for the same period of time as an official. You will not be punished for not having scrimmage demos, but please understand we can and will ask for these when investigating or resolving disputes, and not having them will typically levy further suspicion on you.

If you are unsure on how to do this, we provide a guide in our Guides dropdown. TLDR; These POVs cannot be uploaded video recordings; they must be Player POV Demos (STV Demos are not satisfactory either).

## Failure to Record Penalty
Failing to provide a POV to the staff team upon request within 48 hours will result in the following punishment:
- First offence - 3 match ban.
- Second offence - removal from the season.
- Further offences - removal from the league.
