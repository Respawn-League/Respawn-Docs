# POV Demo Recording
**All players are expected to record POV demos of their matches**. **Upon request by the staff team, the POV needs to be submitted within 48 hours**. Reports of a player cheating or other disputes may also get your POV requested. **POV Demos must be kept for 6 months from their recorded date.**

If you are unsure on how to do this, we provide a guide in our Guides dropdown. TLDR; These POVs cannot be uploaded video recordings; they must be Player POV Demos (STV Demos are not satisfactory either).

## Failure to Record Penalty
Failing to provide a POV to the staff team upon request within 48 hours will result in the following punishment:
- First offence - 3 match ban.
- Second offence - removal from the season.
- Further offences - removal from the league.
