# POV Recording
**All players are expected to record POV demos of their matches**. **Upon request by the staff team, the POV needs to be submitted within 48 hours**. Reports of a player cheating or other disputes may also get your POV requested. **POV Demos must be kept for 6 months from their recorded date.**

If you are unsure on how to do this, we provide a guide in our Guides dropdown. TLDR; These POVs cannot be uploaded video recordings; they must be Player POV Demos (STV Demos are not satisfactory either).
