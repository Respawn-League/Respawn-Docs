# POV Recording
All players are expected to record POV demos of their matches. Upon request by the staff team, the POV needs to be submitted within 48 hours. Reports of a player cheating or other disputes may also get your POV requested.
If you are unsure on how to do this, we provide a guide in our Highlander Guide. TLDR; These POVs cannot be uploaded video recordings; they must be Player POV Demos (STV Demos are not satisfactory either).
