# Submitting Scores
After a match is complete one of the team leaders (generally the winning teamâ€™s) must submit the scores on their match page. Please submit *logs.tf links* for each map and any other needed details here as well. Mercenary approval must be completed and posted in match communications prior to the beginning of the match. **All final submissions must be in before 11:59PM AEST on Friday** for AU/NZ, **11:59PM SGT (GMT+8) on Sunday** for Asia at the end of match week, with failure to do so resulting in a Mutual Forfeit.
