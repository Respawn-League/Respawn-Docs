# Submitting Scores
After a match is complete one of the team leaders (generally the winning teamâ€™s) must submit the scores on their match page. Please submit logs.tf links and any other needed details here as well. All final submissions must be in before 11:59PM AEST on Friday at the end of match week, with failure to do so resulting in a Technical Forfeit.
