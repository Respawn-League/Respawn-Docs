# Rosters & Transfers

## Player Pool
The Player Pool is the area of each team where players invited to the team are listed publically. **Players within the Player Pool that are not on the Active Roster are counted as Mercenaries** (see the Mercenaries page on the sidebar).

## Active Roster
The Active Roster contains each and every player you count as a core or subsitute player and can be used throughout the season. Players need to be requested to be transfered from the Player Pool to the Active Roster prior to their usage in an official match.

## Transfers
Player transfers are reviewed on a weekly basis, and you can expect those transfers to be processed typically within 24 hours of the last match of the week being played. 

## Emergency Transfers
Emergency Transfers are granted by the staff team for situations where teams have an unavoidable player loss on their roster. The amount of players granted and conditions are heavily case-by-case and up to the discretion of the staff team. The best way to request this process is via our support bot Alfred, as the entire staff team will immediately be able to see the request, but you can message your division or region administrator if need be.
