# Associated Punishments
We will determine if punishments delivered by other leagues will be mirrored by us on a case-by-case basis. We will evaluate every ban given by other leagues to decide whether we will provide the same punishment or a modified punishment if we deliver any discipline.
If you have been banned from another league and wish to participate in Respawn League, reach out to our staff team to have the penalty reviewed before participating in a team.
If you are found to be found hiding or trying to involve a player that falls into this category on your roster, you will receive a captaincy ban along with your teamâ€™s immediate removal from the active season.
