# Exploits
The intention of exploiting any aspect of the game for an unfair advantage, whether they are listed in the rules or not, is prohibited.
Some examples include, but are not limited to:
Edge bugging/pixel glitching of any kind.
Exploiting the map design to enter areas which aren’t regular gameplay, for any means or use.
Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement or engine restrictions
Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay, including but not limited to interpolation switchers, hud_reloadscheme stutters, or anything that causes a networked load on other clients.
Placing the Engineer’s buildings outside of the map, in indestructible locations or anywhere where it is not visible.
If you are unsure that something is considered an exploit, please contact the staff team and request a ruling to be made.
