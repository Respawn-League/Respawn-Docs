# Out of Region Teams / Players
Respawn officially supports Australia + New Zealand(AUS/NZ) and Asia(ASIA). Teams from outside of these regions will not be able to participate in regular seasonal competitions.

**Players from other regions require express permission from an admin to participate**. If you plan to roster an out-of-region player, please contact our staff team so we can keep track of such players and approve them. We are enforcing a maximum limit of 3 out-of-region players per team, any breach of this will result in penalties.

If you have enquiries relating to this, feel free to contact us.
