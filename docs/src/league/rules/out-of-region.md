# Out of Region Teams / Players
Respawn officially supports Australia + New Zealand(AUS/NZ) and Asia(ASIA). Teams from outside of these regions will not be able to participate in regular seasonal competitions.

**Players from other regions require express permission from an admin to participate**. If you plan to roster an out-of-region player, please contact our staff team so we can keep track of such players and approve them. We are enforcing a maximum limit of 3 out-of-region players per team, any breach of this will result in penalties.

Players wishing to play in both of our supported regions for the same gamemode can seek approval from an RSL administrator.

If you have questions, feel free to contact us.
