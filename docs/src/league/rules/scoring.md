# Scoring

## Match Scoring
2 points are awarded to the winner of each map in a match, with 4 points being the maximum possible score for a game. In matches where a team forfeits the winning team will be awarded 4 points. Technical forfeits grant each team 2 points, and mutual forfeits will not reward either team.

## Map Scoring
Payload & Attack / Defend maps are scored depending on who won the "half" (each team defends and attacks once per half), meaning if you are playing a weekly fixture and manage to beat the other team's time and win the map, the map is counted as 1-0 to you. If your team doesn't beat the other team's time, then it is a 0-1 (or a 1-0 to them).

King of the Hill (KOTH) and Control Point (CP) maps are scored off of round wins, meaning if you won 3-2 then you would report the score as a 3-2.
