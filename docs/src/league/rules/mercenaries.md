# Mercenaries
**Mercenaries(Mercs) are considered players that are not on the active roster of a team** at the time of the match being played. **Eligible Mercenaries require a league account**, and **cannot have any active bans** in the league. **Mercenaries cannot be banned by Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)**.

A maximum of **two Mercenaries are allowed per match**, but you cannot use the same Mercenary in more than three official games.

Communicate the wanted use of mercs to the other teamâ€™s captain at least an **hour prior to the official match time** where possible. Mercs **MUST** be allowed by the enemy captain before they can be used in a game. Captains have the right to deny unreasonable mercs.

Mercenaries can only be sourced from the same division or below (for example: Premier players cannot play in Main matches unless approved by an administrator first), any mercenary found playing in a division below where they are currently or were recently playing will receive a penalty, along with the captain who requested them. If both teams agree to a Premier mercenary they can seek administrator approval for allowing that mercenary to play, but we reserve the right to deny mercenaries who we believe may be unreasonable, and if need be forcibly class lock or restrict them for match play in that division for the season duration.

Additionally, mercenaries can only be from within the same region they are being "merced" in. The only exclusion to this is for out of region players who are currently participating in that region and otherwise previously allowed by the staff team.

Contact a staff member if you feel your mercs are being unreasonably denied and a staff member can step in to make a final decision. We typically ask that three __reasonable__ mercenaries are asked for. A League Administrator is more than capable of helping you discern whether or not a player is reasonable.
You are required to put a valid RSL league account name (rsl.tf/users/xxxx) in the match communications for any allowed mercs.
