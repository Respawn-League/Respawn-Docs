# Pausing
- Both teams are permitted a maximum of 3 pauses in each match(not per map).
- Each pause is limited to 5 minutes, but combined will not surpass 10 minutes. 

How you use the pauses are up to you, but **cannot in any circumstances be used within the first 10 minutes of the match**.

If the other team permits it, a longer pause can be used. 

Failure to unpause or go over the allowed time will result in penalties.
