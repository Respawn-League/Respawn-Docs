# Team Responsibilities
Team captains are responsible for organising games for their team, and communicating with admins when needed. If a team captain isn’t available for a period of time, designate someone to act in their stead with admins when required.
If a team feels their current captain isn’t correctly representing their team or managing it, a majority of the core roster(players regularly playing official matches) are able to apply for a mutiny. Contact a staff member for further questions.

Within a match the following teams take on the following responsibilities:

### Home
- Acquiring a server for the match to be played on
- Passing server details to the other team

### Home & Away
- Negotiating and confirming the match date and time
- Ensuring the server is properly configured (config is executed) prior to readying up
- Posting all match details in the Match Comms page including scores, mercenaries, and logs
- Notifying staff of disputes/rule-breaking
- Maintaining a minimum of 7 players in the game server at all times
- Reporting and confirming the score after the game has finished
