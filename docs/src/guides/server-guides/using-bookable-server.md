# Using a Bookable Server
As Qixalite is our main server provider for Asia-Pacific, it's most likely you'll be using one of their servers to play out your scrim or official matches. Thankfully, Qixalite has a handy guide on their own documentation website that can step you through the process. It's good to keep in mind that any command that says it uses an "alias" will likely only work on Qixalite, but any other command (`rcon changelevel pl_upward_pro_b3` or `rcon exec configname.cfg`) should work on most servers!

>It is important to note when switching the map on a Qixalite server that it may not actually be on the server. They use a plugin to download your requested map if it is not already there. For example, if you use `rcon changelevel cp_steel_pro_rc1` but the map isn't on the server, it will let you know in the ingame chat and starts to download it for you!
