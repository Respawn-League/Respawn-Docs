# Server Guide Hub

We have received a plethora of questions over the past few years regarding how to setup a game server, what the requirements are and if you can "self host" your own server. Below are some basic guidelines on server requirements when not using a bookable server from an existing bookable provider (Qixalite, serveme.tf, ozfortress, PURE League, etc.):

- Servers should not be hosted on a residential connection, no matter how good. The issue isn't always the available bandwidth or network speed, but the fact that residential connections typically aren't protected from DOS attacks or other forms of malicious activity.
- Server should be hosted within the region you play in.
- You can either rent a server off of a game server provider (Streamline Servers, Wombat Servers, etc.) or setup your own on a high-performance VPS or Dedicated Server.

If you are unsure where your hosted server falls, feel free to contact a League Administrator via DMs or #admin-support / #ticket-support.

Staff will not however offer support or resolve technical server issues for you. **You are own your own with server setup, maintenance and administration.**
