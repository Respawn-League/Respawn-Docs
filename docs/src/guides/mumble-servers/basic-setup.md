# Basic Setup
**The very basics. This will help you run and administrate your Mumble Server.**

## Getting Administrator Permissions
Sadly, we use a cloned template database when setting up your Mumble Server. While this is good as it removes the need for SuperUser, it means we have to manually add Administrator permissions to your user. There are some things you can do to prepare though:
- Register Self - By right clicking on your username in the Mumble Server, you can click Register Self. By registering yourself, Staff can add your Permissions whenever we can. Without doing this, we have to get you in with us which means we're having to schedule something.
- Schedule a time with an administrator to be in your new server to receive permissions - best to do this through the ticket you created!

*PLEASE NOTE: We have setup a Moderator role / group for every new server. Please, make use of this. You (the owner) are the only person who should ever have Administrator. All new channels should be setup under the Channels category, unless you really know what you are doing with permissions.*

## Managing Users
You can also Register User, which allows you to register users in your server and manipulate them either via permissions or moving them. You can also see all Registered Users under Server > Registered Users.
Changing the Mumble Server Name or the Welcome Message

Sadly, only Staff can change the Mumble Server's Name as it requires backend access.
As with the Mumble Name, only Staff can change the Welcome Message as it also requires backend access.
