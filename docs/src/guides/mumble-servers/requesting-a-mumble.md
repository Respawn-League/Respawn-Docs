# Requesting a Mumble Server

## The Template
We don't have any restrictions on the use of the Free Mumble Servers, we just ask that it's loosely Team Fortress 2 related. If you are unsure on what to put, you can use the Template below:

```
Username: 
Desired Mumble Name: 
Custom Password (not required but encouraged):
What do you want to use the server for?:
```

## Submitting
We use our Discord's Ticket Tool Bot to take Mumble requests, Support Requests and more. Staff will respond as soon as possible, but the setup can be a day or more depending on our current workload.
