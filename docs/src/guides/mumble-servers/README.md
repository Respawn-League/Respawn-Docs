# Why do we provide Free Mumble Servers?


## Some Background
For almost a year, Respawn League (formerly soundsys.tf) has been providing Mumble Servers for the community. We've actually been doing it since before we were a league. It started with just one large server everyone had access to, to now having separate channels and the capability to host hundreds of separate servers.

## This isn't an expensive endeavour
We've had a lot of people ask if hosting this as a free service is expensive. For reference, most providers will sell a 30 slot Mumble at 72kb/s audio quality for $10 AUD minimum per month. We host this for free at 96kb/s + 18 slots, and for a couple of dollars a month through Paypal you will get a 50 slot server, 112/kb/s server with dedicated resources and best of all, it will be completely unbranded (free still branded)!

## We're still working on things!
Things are constantly changing. We will do our best to keep everybody up to date and informed, but we ask that you are patient with us. This is after all, a free service.
